Natural Language Analysis for identifying authors based on excerpts

**Project Title: ** Spooky Author Identification

**Project Outline: ** Predict the author of excerpts from horror stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and HP Lovecraft.

**Goals:**

* Analyze sentence length, word length, word variety (vocabulary), punctuation, pronoun usage, and sentiment scores for each author in a training dataset
* Perform probability analysis for each text and predict authorship on a test dataset with no assigned authorship
* Compare analyses on training dataset to the test dataset once authorship has been assigned

**Notes:**

* Uses Kaggle dataset for the Spooky Author Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification)
* The NLTK library requires an additional download. See Interactive Installer in <http://www.nltk.org/data.html>  for more information.
